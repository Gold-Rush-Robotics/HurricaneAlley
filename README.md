# Tracking Progress
Each "major" section of the competition is being divided up with projects (ie there is a Vision project, a Picker-Upper project, a Drivebase project, and a General project). If you are interested in one of these projects in general and want to know how to help, look at the issues page and see what needs to be done!

# Vision
A big part of this year's competition will be figuring out what objects are where in relation to the robot so it can pick them up.

# Drivebase 2.0
Last year we designed a drivebase from scratch using mecanum wheels so that we could use it as a base for future competitions. With that being said there is room for improvement, especially with the software and electrical components.

# Picker-Upper
We need to develop a system to pick up orient, and store ducks and pillars as well as set them down properly.
